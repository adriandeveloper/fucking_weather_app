# Fucking Weather App
### A simple weather app that swears
Fucking Weather is an simle weather app that pulls the weather in your area using your location and returns a weather report.

## Getting Started

Insure that you have React Native installed onto your machine.  

If you don't, you can find the instructions on how to install React Native [here.](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)


### Installing and running Fucking Weather App


1. Fork or clone this project and ```cd``` into the project directory.
2. Run ```yarn install``` or ```npm install```
3. Run ```react-native run-ios``` for the IOS version or ```react-native run-android``` for the Android version.

### What's Next?

I want to extend this app more. Perhaps add a lot more sayings and instead of plain colors, maybe download an image or work with the Animate library in React Native to animate some svg's of the weather.  Also I may add push notifications if the weather changes.  I also want to deploy this to the Google Play and App Stores just to get experience with how to deploy apps to those platforms.
